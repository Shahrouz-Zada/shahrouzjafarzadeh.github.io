I’m a researcher and instructor in Quantitative Finance, Programming, and Machine Learning / AI applied to Finance and Business.
I hold a Doctorate in Quantitative Finance, where I explored market antifragility modeling through machine learning and mathematical methods.

My commitment to academia is driven by a deep passion for applying science, mathematics, and technology  to address real-world problems; particularly in finance. I thrive on transforming complex concepts into accessible, engaging learning experiences through project-based teaching.

In my higher education teaching experience, I have taught Bachelor’s and Master’s-level courses such as:

- Financial Modeling

- Python and Data Analysis for Finance

- Machine Learning and AI for Finance and Marketing

- Mathematical modules including Differential Equations, Time Series Analysis, and Stochastic Processes

I aim not only to help students build knowledge and confidence to apply quantitative tools in real-world contexts, but also to bridge academia and industry through practical, data-driven learning.

My professional background includes positions at Natixis and Nexus Horizon, where I contributed to projects ranging from security management to quantitative research.
Across both teaching and industry work, I emphasize applied problem-solving using real financial data to connect theory, modeling, and practice.
